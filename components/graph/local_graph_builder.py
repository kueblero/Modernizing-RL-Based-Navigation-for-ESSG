        Calculates a soft visibility score for an object, ranging from 0 (not visible) to 1 (fully visible).

        The score is computed using a sigmoid function based on the distance between the agent and the object.
        To account for the fact that larger objects can typically be seen from further away, the center of the
        sigmoid is dynamically adjusted based on the maximum dimension of the object (`max_dim`):

            - `base_center` sets the reference distance for objects of size `ref_size`.
            - For objects larger than `ref_size`, the sigmoid center is shifted farther away, making them easier
              to see from a distance.
            - The sharpness of the sigmoid controls how quickly the visibility score drops off as the distance increases.
